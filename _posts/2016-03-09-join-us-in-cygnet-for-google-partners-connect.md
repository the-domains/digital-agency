# Join Us In Cygnet For Google Partners Connect

The Internet gives every business a chance to achieve success. We'd like to invite you to join our agency for a Google livestream event where you'll learn from both Google and our team about how to grow your business online.

# 4 May 2016 11:45 -- 1:45 AEST

# Google Speakers

## Katy Berg   
Google Partners Marketing Manager, Google Australia & New Zealand

Katy will share Google's recent Micro Moments research, explaining how mobile has changed what people expect from businesses. She'll show the opportunities this has created for shaping customers' decisions and preferences, and touch on why now is a great time to promote your business online.   

## Elizabeth Fox  
Head of Agency Relationships, Google Australia & New Zealand

Elizabeth will cover the practical first step your business can take to be found online, with a free listing on Google My Business. She'll discuss why it's important for customers to quickly find or contact your business, even if you don't have a website. You'll also hear about why digital advertising is a great next step in your roadmap for winning customers.    

# Space is Limited.
